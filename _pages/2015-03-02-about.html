<p>My name's Jia-Shen Boon, a robotics researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our prototype hexacopter can be seen below. I'm also supposed to be a native Chinese speaker, though I'm more comfortable with English. For reasons unknown I also love the Japanese language and have studied it for many years.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I'm currently looking for gainful employment. If you're a recruiter/employer with a full-time position that fits my skill sets, please contact me! My contact information can be found in my resume. よろしくお願いします。</span></p>
