<p>My name's Jia-Shen Boon. I'm currently living in Seattle, WA, working at Amazon as a software engineer. Prior to Seattle, I did my MsCS in the beautifully frigid campus ofÂ the University of Wisconsin-Madison; prior to <em>that</em>, I was a research engineer in Singapore, the sunny sweaty island that I call home.</p>
<p>I intend for this site to simply be a repository of miscellany. I hope you found what you came here for.</p>
