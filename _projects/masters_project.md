The ability to map one's environment and locate oneself within that map has always been important in robotics. This capability has applications in augmented reality as well. It is possible to realize this capability just with one or more cameras, but the resulting system has one serious flaw during a failure mode known as "track failure". In this report, we argue that in the bid to achieve the aforementioned capability it is overwhelmingly beneficial to the system engineer to have a sensor suite consisting at least of a camera and an inertial measurement unit, instead of solely having a camera.
