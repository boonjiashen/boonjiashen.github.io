Recently I've been playing around with web development and it's been a lot of fun! Most of my work has been algorithmic development that's more or less silo-ed off to a corner of the world, butÂ it seems to make sense from a societal perspective for the benefits of one's work to be shared as widely as possible, e.g., through the web.

To that end, I ported the photographic mosaicker (detailed in my previous post) over to Python and deployed it on a Heroku app.

[Edit on Sept 6, 2021] Find links in <a class="page-link" href="/projects/">Projects page.</a>\\
~~[Edit on July 22, 2021] I've migrated the app off Heroku on to AWS. The new link is [here](https://mosaic.boonjiashen.com).~~\\
~~You can try mosaicking your own picture [here](https://photomosaick.herokuapp.com/)!~~

Source code can be found on Github [[link](https://github.com/boonjiashen/heroku_simple_image_processing)].
