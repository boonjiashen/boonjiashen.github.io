Welcome to my website!  

My name is Jia Shen, I'll be your host for tonight.  

I work for a research and development company in Singapore as an engineer. I intend to go to graduate school soon.  

In this site I'll be sharing some of my personal projects and maybe some of my personal views on different "worldly matters". One objective would be to improve my writing skills along the way. Hopefully I'll get some momentum going with this blog. Let's get started!
