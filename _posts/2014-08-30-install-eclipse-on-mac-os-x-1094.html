I am now on the other side of the globe in Madison, Wisconsin. Now that I've settled down I'm hoping to continue pushing out content. I recently bought a MacBook Air, having never used a Mac in my life, and today I'll talk about <b>how to install Eclipse on OS X 10.9.4</b>. There wasn't a one-stop recipe when I had to do this last week, but I've written one here for you!<br /><ol><li>Download the Eclipse installer from the Eclipse website [<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?osType=macosx">link</a>]. For me, this is Eclipse Standard 4.4 Mac OS X 64-bit.</li><li>Unzip the .tar.gz file. You should see a folder named 'eclipse'. Move this folder to the Applications folder of your Mac.</li><li>Double-click the file 'Eclipse' in the eclipse folder to launch Eclipse.</li></ol>At this point, you may see a message saying "Version 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suitable for this product. Version: 1.7 or greater is required.". To do that, follow the following instructions.<br /><ol><li>Download the latest Java development kit from Oracle website [<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">link</a>]. At the time of writing, that&nbsp;is jdk-8u20-macosx-x64.dmg.</li><li>Double-click the .dmg file and follow the instructions to install the JDK.</li><li>You should be able to launch Eclipse now - again, by double-clicking the file 'Eclipse' in the eclipse folder.</li></ol><div>I hope that works for you! We live in exciting times.</div><div><br /></div><div>Reference: Eclipse forum [<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/792447/">link</a>]</div>
