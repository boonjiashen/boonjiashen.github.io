Unfortunately, I won't be writing on my robotics pet project for a while, because I'll be heading over to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for my Master's in Computer Science, and in preparation for the move I've dismantled TOHNKATSU. Ah well.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I'll be sharing some small tips about Vim today, which to be honest I feel is one of the few things I'm qualified to teach.<br /><br />Today's topic is on <b>navigating a line in Vim's Normal mode</b>. That's the mode that you enter when you hit <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;Esc&gt;</span>. Many of you probably know that <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">/my_search_term</span> jumps forward to a search term, <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">?my_search_term</span> is the equivalent in the backwards direction, <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">14G</span> brings you to line 14, etc, but really, we spend a disproportionate amount of time just navigating a single line in Vim. That's why it's important and that's why we're talking about it today!<br /><br /><b>Jump to a character</b><br /><b><br /></b><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">A bad brown fox jumps over my steely dan!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; ^ &nbsp; ^ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; 2Fb Fb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cursor &nbsp;fe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2fe</span><br /><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></b></div><div>The command is <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">f&lt;char&gt;</span> to jump rightwards and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">F&lt;char&gt;</span> to jump leftwards. As with many Vim commands, prepend a number <i>n</i> to execute the command <i>n</i> times, e.g. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">2f&lt;char&gt;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;is equivalent to executing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">f&lt;char&gt;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;"> twice. Super useful, especially for small edits in a word or a short phrase.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><b><span style="font-family: inherit;">Jump before a character</span></b></div><div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">She's really fun to hang out with (if you know what I mean).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; ^ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ^</span><br /><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; &nbsp; T' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cursor &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t)</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>This is pretty much the same as above, except the cursor jumps to the character just before your search character. The command is&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">t&lt;char&gt;</span>&nbsp;to jump rightwards and&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">T&lt;char&gt;</span>&nbsp;to jump leftwards. Maybe not as universally useful as <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">f</span>/<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">F</span>, but it's really handy if you're a programmer and there are all these mathematical operators (<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">+-*/</span>) that you want to jump next to - not directly to, but next to.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Wrap up</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Just like most commands in Vim, you'll almost certainly need to consciously incorporate these into your editing/programming habits, but it'll become second-nature soon enough. Remember to combine these with the standard commands like <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">d</span> for delete and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">y</span> for yank, e.g. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">dfe</span> deletes all characters up to and including the next <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">e</span>, and <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">yt)</span> copies all characters up to but excluding the next closing bracket.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm sure these will be useful to you. Enjoy!</div>
