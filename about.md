My name's Boon Jia Shen. I'm currently living in Tokyo, Japan, working at [Amazon](https://amazon.jobs/) as a software engineer in Search. I spent several years at the Amazon headquarters in Seattle with the Customer Q&A team, and was also once a research engineer in the [Defence Science Organization](https://www.dso.org.sg/) in Singapore, working on Projects That Cannot Be Named.

I did my Master's in Computer Science in the beautifully frigid campus of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), and my Bachelor of Engineering in the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). Sometimes I miss those cold winter days in Wisconsin, though I suspect that's just the nostalgia speaking.

This blog is meant to be an avenue for me to improve my writing skills, which I'm told is a critical tool for developing clarity of thought.

## Questions about my name

#### _Q: How should I address you?_

Professionally, I go by Boon. It's pronounced just like the English word "boon".

Boon is actually is my family name (a.k.a. last name) while Jia Shen is my given name (a.k.a. first name). For simplicity's sake, I tend to introduce myself using my family name.

#### _Q: If Boon is your last name, why is it Boon Jia Shen and not Jia Shen Boon?_

My full name would be written as "Boon Jia Shen" in Singapore, where this naming order is common for people with Chinese names. Apparently this naming order is known as _[Eastern order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Name_order)_. Examples in famous people include [Lee Kuan Yew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew), first Prime Minister of Singapore whose family name is Lee, and [Yao Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_Ming), former NBA player whose family name is Yao.

I spent a couple of years in the US, which follows the _[Western name order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name#Western_name_order)_. That's when I switched the order of my family and given names, especially in employment-related documents like my resume.
