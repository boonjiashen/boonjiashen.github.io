My name's Jia-Shen Boon. I'm currently living in Tokyo, Japan, working at [Amazon](https://amazon.jobs/) as a software engineer in Search. I spent several years at the Amazon headquarters in Seattle with the Customer Q&A team, and was also once a research engineer in the [Defence Science Organization](https://www.dso.org.sg/) in Singapore, working on Projects That Cannot Be Named.

I did my Master's in Computer Science in the beautifully frigid campus of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), and my Bachelor of Engineering in the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/). Sometimes I miss those cold winter days in Wisconsin, though I suspect that's just the nostalgia speaking.

This blog is meant to be an avenue for me to improve my writing skills, which I'm told is a critical tool for developing clarity of thought.
