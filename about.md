My name's Jia-Shen Boon. I'm currently living in Seattle, WA, working at Amazon as a software engineer. Prior to Seattle, I did my MsCS in the beautifully frigid campus ofÂ the University of Wisconsin-Madison; prior to _that_, I was a research engineer in Singapore, the sunny sweaty island that I call home.

I intend for this site to simply be a repository of miscellany. I hope you found what you came here for.
