__TODO__

* Update resume to include time in Tokyo
* Add tags to projects and display them on project page
* Migrate mathjax https://www.mathjax.org/cdn-shutting-down/
* Figure out how to get notified of JS warnings
* Refactor webapp projects to _projects files to reduce code duplication
* Update S3 paths to not include region

__Some day/maybe__

* Publicize my infra and github.io repositories. Maybe in the project page?
