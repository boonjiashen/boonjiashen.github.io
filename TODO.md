__TODO__

* Add a CI GH workflow to check that dependabot succeeds, before merging dependabot PRs
* Update resume to include time in Tokyo
* Add tags to projects and display them on project page
* Migrate mathjax https://www.mathjax.org/cdn-shutting-down/
* Figure out how to get notified of JS warnings
* Refactor webapp projects to _projects files to reduce code duplication

__Some day/maybe__

* Publicize my infra and github.io repositories. Maybe in the project page?
