聴・忍者(chou.ninja)

__Description__

Before I relocated to Tokyo, I had already studied Japanese for a couple of years, both in college and a little after graduation. But I quickly realized upon arrival that my listening comprehension was lacking, especially when it came to numbers. That's when a waitress at a restaurant tells you how much the bill is (e.g., ¥2294), or when friends share the dates of events, like July 4, or 1964.

Looking for solutions, I came across a site called [Gou Ninja](http://gou.ninja/) which is a sort of trainer for listening comprehension, but it had some quirks which I didn't like. For example, it could throw at you inapplicable numbers like ５５時 or 55 o'clock; it didn't support the days of the week, which were of particular interest to me; the UX was also such that you couldn't use the app as you were walking down the street.

To that end, I hacked together a webapp that fit my needs, and named it 聴・忍者 or _chou ninja_, a shameless derivative of its inspiration.

This was an experiment in exposing image processing algorithms to the web.
